# A comprehensive network simulation using ns-3(.30)
## This is a university assignment for our course "Fondamenti di Comunicazione e Internet", i.e. Telecommunications. 
### This was a group project coordinated by me.
Our task was to simulate a network comprised of various technologies and protocols, in particular a Wi-Fi network and multiple wired networks, using PTP links or
CSMA.

Our network topology is included in the _code_ section. 

Our environment was containerized using Docker.
